COOPERA (COst-effective Open-source Platform for Empirical Robotics and Arficial Intelligence) is a robotic platform based on the \emph{Bioloid} robot and it took inspiration from the \emph{iCub} project. \emph{Yarp}, a middleware software developed in the context of the iCub project, was used as a middleware layer to implement a modular and efficient interface between the user and the robot. 
With a modest economic investment (the overall cost of the platform is less than 1500\$) it is possible to own a small and robust 
humanoid with 19 degrees of freedom with a camera, a 32-bit processing unit running linux-based kernel, and a YARP-based interface. 
COOPERA is able to demonstrate experiments involving artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms applied to humanoid 
robots. In spite of its intrinsical limitations, COOPERA is an useful research tool.
In particular, we have used this platform in order to program a robot that is able to learn directly on the real robot (in-vivo) how to stand up using a Reinforcement Learning approach instead of using simulators, as usually done in research.
