task contains conditional effects. turning off state domination.


warning: numeric precondition. turning cost-minimizing relaxed plans OFF.

ff: search configuration is Enforced Hill-Climbing, then A*epsilon with weight 5.
Metric is ((1.00*[RF19](steps)) - () + 0.00)
COST MINIMIZATION DONE (WITHOUT cost-minimizing relaxed plans).
